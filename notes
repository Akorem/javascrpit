high level object oriented programming language
a programming language is just a tool that enables us to write codes that will instruct the computer on what to do for us
can be used for the frontend and backend
variables - are storage facilities/containers 
declarators - const, var- was the only declarator used before ES6(Ecma script), let
values - are those things that are assigned to the variables
let - declare, reassign 
var - declare, redclare, reassign
const - stays the same


constraints in variable naming:
when naming variables do not give space between names we make use of camel casing or underscore and they can never start with a number but it can contain one
when writing variables use a descriptive variable name


DATA TYPES:
string - are usually represented with quotes, they hold letters/alphabets, they have properties and it has methods
number - 
undefined
null
boolean
object 
big int
symbol

Array is a data structure inside the object(filter and map)
Arrays have properties and methods
methods are functions that are related to a data type

loops - for loops - initialixer condition and final expression
        while loop -  do while
conditional statements - else statement
                         if statement
                         else if statement
                         switch

higher order functions - they accept other functions as an argument
call back -are functions that are used as arguments for other functions

FUNCTIONS
we have 3 types - declaration, expression and arrow function


-DECLARATION FUNCTION
function greet((the parameter)){
  console.log('hello')
}
greet('My name is lucifer'(the argument))
* the argument of a declaration function can be placed anywhere either below or above the function itself

-EXPRESSION FUNCTION
let test = function(name){
  console.log(`hello my name is ${name}`)
}

test(Lucifer)

* for expression functions with multiple parameters
let multi = function(name, country){
  console.log(`hello my name is ${name} and i'm from ${country}`)
}

multi(Lucifer, Hell)

-ARROW FUNCTION
let explain = (number)=>{
       let apples = 10
let statement = 'akin was able to buy ' + apples + ' wraps of fufu ' + number
return statement
// console.log(statement); 
}

let description = explain('on his way back from church')
console.log(description);
